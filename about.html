          <p>
            I am a certified graphic designer and illustrator. Self-employed for
            4 years now. I offer comprehensive skills as a certified graphic
            designer and illustrator to strengthen your brand message through
            visually engaging content. My passion for creating unique visual
            communications comes through in my graphics, videos and animations
            as well as my designs and logos. I work with a variety of tools and
            techniques to showcase brands and products through high-quality
            visual communication. With many years of experience as a social
            media manager and content creator with prestigious clients, I bring
            a wide range of skills to manage and implement corporate
            identity/corporate design, layouts, graphics, videos, marketing,
            design management, copy and newsletters, and podcast service.
            Through my work as an experienced graphic designer and illustrator,
            I create a unique visual expression for brands and businesses that
            stands out from the competition and appeals to the target audience.
            I am proud that my clients trust me time and time again to
            strengthen their brand message through my visual communication. If
            you are looking for a reliable and professional partner to take your
